export const prompt = "Create a list of three open-ended and engaging questions formatted as a single string. Each question should be separated by '||'. These questions are for an anonymous social messaging platform, like Qooh.me, and should be suitable for a diverse audience. Avoid personal or sensitive topics, focusing instead on universal themes that encourage friendly interaction. For example, your output should be structured like this: 'What’s a hobby you’ve recently started?||If you could have dinner with any historical figure, who would it be?||What’s a simple thing that makes you happy?'. Ensure the questions are intriguing, foster curiosity, and contribute to a positive and welcoming conversational environment.";
